# Zachary Ong – Hands-On Maker & IoT Innovator

Hi, I am Zachary, a 23-year-old fresh Electronic & Computer Engineering graduate (Class of 2025) from Nanyang Polytechnic.  

I'm passionate about turning real-world problems into practical solutions through **hands-on tinkering**, logical reasoning, and rapid prototyping. I thrive on independent problem-solving, stepping up to lead when needed, and learning new tech quickly to deliver working systems—whether it's IoT for sustainability, mobile apps for everyday use, or robotics prototypes.  

I enjoy building tangible, impactful solutions at the intersection of hardware, software, and data, with a focus on design-thinking, interdisciplinary collaboration, and sustainable tech.

### Key Projects & Leadership Highlights

- **Smart Water Meter Proof-of-Concept (Internship @ Jurong Port Tank Terminal)**  
  [IoT](https://github.com/zacw-243L/JPTT-NYP-SMART-Water-meter-POC)  
  Led development of an IoT prototype using LoRaWAN for industrial remote monitoring. Integrated sensors/hardware for a POC and created detailed documentation for handover. Demonstrated quick mastery of new tech (LoRaWAN/smart metering) and independent execution in a professional setting.

- **EcoSphere – Smart Home (Year 2 Module Project)**  
  [Embeded Systems](https://github.com/zacw-243L/Project-EcoSphere-/tree/main) | [Project Page](https://ongzacoz0.wixsite.com/site/copy-of-p2-1)  
  Chosen as **team lead** for a group of 5 in a 16-week connected systems module. Designed and implemented a subsystem for energy-efficient temperature control using BeagleBone Black Wireless, sensors, and a Python-based web client-server architecture. Motivated the team, delegated tasks, fostered collaboration, and ensured delivery of a working prototype + report/presentation. Earned an A for my subsystem; the team achieved strong overall scores. Focused on sustainability (presence detection, timers), hands-on embedded IoT with real environmental impact.

- **Flutter Transport App (Final Semester Project)**  
  [Mobile App Development](https://github.com/zacw-243L/flutter-transport-app)  
  Built a full cross-platform mobile app for real-time transport tracking using Flutter & Dart, Firebase backend, and intuitive UI. Learned mobile development from scratch while delivering a user-focused, functional product.

- **Robotics CCA Project Lead – Pico W Robot**  
  [Microcontrollers](https://github.com/zacw-243L/Project-Pico-W-for-NYP-robotics-CCA)  
  Took full ownership of a stalled project; wrote core code, coordinated remaining team members (when others dropped out), and delivered a working prototype. Showcased persistence, leadership under pressure, and seamless hardware-software integration with Raspberry Pi Pico W.

- **Image Classification & Database Projects**  
  [Image Classification](https://github.com/zacw-243L/EGE352_DATA_ANALYTIC_Mini_Project-Image_Classification) | [Database Interfacing](https://github.com/zacw-243L/interfacing-with-a-database-the-Pythonic-way)  
  Applied ML (Python/scikit-learn, NumPy/Pandas) for practical image classification, and built robust database systems (MySQL) with clean Python interfaces.

### Skills Snapshot (Ranked by Usage)
- **Core Languages**: Python (heavy use), C#, C, Dart, JavaScript (basic)  
- **Mobile**: Flutter + Firebase  
- **Web**: HTML/CSS, basic JS, Flask  
- **Data/ML**: NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn  
- **Databases**: MySQL, SQLite  
- **Hardware/IoT**: Arduino, Raspberry Pi, LoRaWAN, Mosquitto  
- **Others**: .NET (WinForms/UWP), Git, Power BI  
- **Creative Tools** (Self-taught): Adobe Photoshop, Premiere Pro, Creative Cloud <useful for prototyping visuals, documentation, and leveraging generative AI for enhanced workflows>.

### Let's Connect
Currently serving full-time National Service (until ~2027), so my availability is limited for now.  

I am always interested in connecting about tech, design, innovation and engineering, feel free to reach out for a chat, or stay in touch for future opportunities once things settle
